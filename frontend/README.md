# About

Simple project to learn angular and improve cypress skills.

## Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### TO DO

- finish project :)
- create base url for models and others instead of ../../..
- probably rewrite everything to actually use bootstrap...
- set global-height or change idea to another display - now looks weird...
- separate copies and borrowed games in the future (ahjooo)
